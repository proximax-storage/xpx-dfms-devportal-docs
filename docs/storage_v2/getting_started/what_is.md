title: What is Sirius Storage?
---

**[Sirius Storage](what_is.md)** is a distributed file management platform that enables autonomous distribution of storage network capability, providing open disk space usability to multiple level consumers using peer-to-peer architecture. Given its open and autonomical nature, multiple levels of usage, applicability and participation can be achieved.

## Participation

Sirius Storage owners can participate as [Replicators](../roles/replicator.md). Consumers such as developers, document management systems and application owners can use the platform to store all sorts of digital binary data, while Supercontracts developers can use it as an off-chain storage and execution environment.

## Peer-to-Peer Architecture

The entire Sirius Storage design is based on the core fundamentals of the peer-to-peer technology. Storage nodes can stand on their own, but stability and capability can be maximized with mutliple similar Storage nodes that communicate via standard network technology stack.

## Application Programming Interface

The design of Sirius Storage is to allow developers and technology experts to quickly integrate the platform to their respective systems through the Storage SDK.

## Libraries and Supporting Tools

Sirius Storage gives its users the ability to create and configure a new [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) or a [Download Channel](../built_in_features/drive/lifecycle.md#download). It provides tools for further interacting with users' files. Since each user pays for the Drive, the Sirius Storage makes it possible to reliably and safely store their files. It also guarantees the fairness of the distribution of payments for users who participate in data storing.

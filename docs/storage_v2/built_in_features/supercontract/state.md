Any [SC](overview.md) can have the following states:

| Name        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unknown** | the [SC](overview.md) status is unknown (execution [lifecycle](lifecycle.md) does not imply this state. If a user gets it that means something is wrong) |
| **Started** | the [SC](overview.md) is executing                                                                                                                       |
| **Success** | the [SC](overview.md) execution finished successfully                                                                                                    |
| **Failure** | the [SC](overview.md) execution finished failure                                                                                                         |

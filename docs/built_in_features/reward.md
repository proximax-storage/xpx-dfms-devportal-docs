## Rewards for files

If the drive account has [SM](../getting_started/economy.md#sm) on the balance and the drive has [**Pending**](drive/state.md#pending) or [**Finished**](drive/state.md#finished) state, [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) can send the transaction to get the [reward](reward.md) for files transferring during the billing period. The consensus of [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) decides who will be the initiator. The initiator collects receipts ([Fair Streaming](../protocols/fair_streaming.md) protocol) from [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) and the [owner](../roles/owner.md) and after creates the get rewards transaction and announces it to Blockchain. Other [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) validate it (the [owner](../roles/owner.md) doesn't validate it), and cosign it in case everything is correct.

If the transaction contains information about [replicators](../roles/replicator.md), which didn't put the deposit for active files or uploaded size equals zero, blockchain will reject it.

Replicators should send information about all files uploaded during a billing period. But before sending this information, [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) should validate receipts of each other, so everyone makes sure that they are related to the same billing period accordingly. Uploaded information can be collected via [Fair Streaming](../protocols/fair_streaming.md). After confirmation of the transaction, all [SM](../getting_started/economy.md#sm) that stored on the balance of the drive's account will be spread proportionally uploaded data. Only then [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) can delete receipts.

In case the drive has the [**Finished**](drive/state.md#finished) state, but the drive account contains [SM](../getting_started/economy.md#sm) on its balance, [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) still can send the get reward's transaction. After the confirmation, blockchain prunes info about the drive from cache after 360 blocks, the [multisig account](https://bcdocs.xpxsirius.io/docs/built-in-features/multisig-account/) will be removed.

## Rewards for drive

At the end of each billing, period [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) get their [reward](reward.md) for participation in the drive. The billingPrice of the drive is distributed between all [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) that passed [verification](../algorithms/verification.md). Every [replicator](../roles/replicator.md) gets the [reward](reward.md) appropriate to its time in the contract (formula below). If it was the last billing period, then the deposit would be returned to honest [replicators](../roles/replicator.md).

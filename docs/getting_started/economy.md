## Sirius Internal Digial Assets: Mosaics

The [DFMS](what_is.md) uses three types of [mosaics](https://bcdocs.xpxsirius.io/docs/built-in-features/mosaic/) that are intended for different goals.

### Sirius Platform Native Token - XPX

XPX is the native token the fuels the token economy of ProximaX SiriusPlatform. It's primarily the basis of all internal tokens and it's pegged to the free market usage of the platform. From the Storage (or DFMS) perspective, XPX is the main cryptocurrency to access it's ecosystem.

XPX is the main currency in the [DFMS](what_is.md). It can be changed to any currency according to market price.

### Sirius Storage units - SO

In ProximaX Sirius Platform, the economic value of the core service relies on the utility tokens the circulates in the respective service ecosystem. In the Sirius Storage ecosystem, Storage units are the utility tokens that represents both service capacity and capability. Each storage owner that participats needs to stake XPX which in turn will be internally exhanged (via Decentralized Internal Exchange Mechanism) to Storage Units.  This representation of stake is the agreement that the storage owner will provide the level of storage service and contribute it to the network. 

SO is the currency for participation in the [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md). Each [replicator](../roles/replicator.md) should deposit SO to the [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) account to join it.

### Streaming units - SM

In Sirius Streaming, SM represents streaming capacity and capability. SM is primarily to represent streaming of data from multiple source of entry to one of multiple source of exit. SM is the currency for file transfer [rewards](../built_in_features/reward.md). Users receive these units for distributing files and pay for getting files.

### SuperContract units - SC

In Sirius Supercontracts, SC represents execution unit and the amount of unit need is relative to the complexity of the logically computed execution. GAS is the currency for executing SC.

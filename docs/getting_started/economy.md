## Mosaics
The [DFMS](what_is.md) uses three types of [mosaics](https://bcdocs.xpxsirius.io/docs/built-in-features/mosaic/) that are intended for different goals.
### XPX
XPX is the main currency in the [DFMS](what_is.md). It can be changed to any currency according to market price.
### Storage units (SO)
SO is the currency for participation in the [drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md). Each [replicator](../roles/replicator.md) should deposit SO to the [drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) account to join it.
### Streaming units (SM)
SM is the currency for file transfer [rewards](../built_in_features/reward.md). Users receive these units for distributing files and pay for getting files.

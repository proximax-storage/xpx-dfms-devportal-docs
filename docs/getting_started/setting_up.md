This guide explains what software you need to install and how to start using the [Sirius Storage](what_is.md).

## DFMS node

First of all, you need to download the [Sirius Storage](what_is.md) binary file according to your OS. Then you can run it.

## CLI

There are two types of CLI:

- [dfms](../cli/dfms/dfms.md) - used by the client ([owner](../roles/owner.md));
- [dfmsr](../cli/dfmsr/dfmsr.md) - used by the [replicator](../roles/replicator.md).

To run as the client you need to run:

```console
$ dfms --key=<your_private_key>
```

To run as the [replicator](../roles/replicator.md) you need to run 

```console
$ dfmsr --key=<your_private_key>
```

>**Note** \
To get more information about any command and its flags you need to use ‘-h’ flag, for example ‘dfms contract -h’

Both have similar commands to interact with the network. For more details, see the CLI item. Also, see how to connect to the other nodes.

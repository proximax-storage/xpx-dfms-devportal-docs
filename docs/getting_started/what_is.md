title: What is Distributed File Management System (DFMS)?
---

## Distributed File Management System (DFMS)

[DFMS](what_is.md) is a distributed file management platform that enables autonomous distribution of storage network capability, providing open disk space usability to multiple level consumers and a virtual execution machine for [Supercontracts]() using peer-to-peer architecture. Given it's open and autonomical nature, multiple level of usage, applicability and participation can be achieved.

## Multiple Participation
[DFMS](what_is.md) Storage owners can participate as replicators and [Supercontracts]() executors. Consumers such as developers, document management systems and application owners can use the platform to store all sorts of digital binary data, while [Supercontracts]() developers can use it as an off-chain storage and execution environment. The platform itself uses advance encryption mechanism to build a level of proof and protection on top of the binary files.

## Peer to Peer Architecture
The entire Sirius Storage design is based on the core fundamentals of peer to peer technology. Storage nodes can stand on it's own but it's stability and capability can be maximized with mutliple similar storage node that communicates via a standard network technology stack.

## Application Programming Interface
The design of Sirius Storage is to allow developers and technology experts to quickly integrate the platform to their respective systems. 

## Libraries and Supporting Tools

[DFMS](what_is.md) gives its users the ability to [create and configure a new drive](../guides/contract/compose.md). It provides tools for further interacting with users' files. Since each user pays for the [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md), the [DFMS](what_is.md) makes it possible to reliably and safely store their files. It also guarantees the fairness of the distribution of payments for users who save this data.

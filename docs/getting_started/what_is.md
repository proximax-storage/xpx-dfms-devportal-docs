title: What is DFMS?

## Distributed File Management System (DFMS)

[DFMS](what_is.md) is an open storage that allows users to upload and save their data. The network is completely decentralized through a peer-to-peer distributed architecture. [DFMS](what_is.md) is open for all registered users, so everyone can upload and download files. For private data the user can use encryption before uploading it, thus he or she makes sure that the data is securely protected.

Additionally, [DFMS](what_is.md) gives its users the ability to [create and configure a new drive](../guides/contract/compose.md). It provides tools for further interacting with users' files. Since each user pays for the [drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md), the [DFMS](what_is.md) makes it possible to reliably and safely store their files. It also guarantees the fairness of the distribution of payments for users who save this data.

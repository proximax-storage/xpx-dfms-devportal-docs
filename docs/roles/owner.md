## Overview

The [owner](owner.md) is a [DFMS](../getting_started/what_is.md) role that initiates files storage in the network. To create a new [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md), the [owner](owner.md) should prepare and create a new [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) account.

## What does the owner do

1. The [owner](owner.md) creates a [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) account and prepares it with desired properties. When the [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) is prepared, the [owner](owner.md) must transfer [XPX](../getting_started/economy.md#xpx) to [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md) balance that equals at least one billing period.
2. The [owner](owner.md) can upload, remove, rename, move, download files and directories in [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md). Every action has its price and must be paid by the [owner](owner.md).
3. The [owner](owner.md) can initiate verification of storing files by [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) (the [Challenge](../built_in_features/challenge.md)). Each [owner](owner.md) wants to save its file safe and secure.
4. The [owner](owner.md) makes payments to [replicators](../roles/replicator.md). When the [owner](owner.md) doesn't pay for the next billing period [replicators](../roles/replicator.md) can terminate the [Drive](../built_in_features/drive/overview.md).
